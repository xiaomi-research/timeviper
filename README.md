# 📰 News
- **[2025.11.25]** We provide model **w/ Nano or w/ Qwen** as backbones, and evaluation codes for **MCQ (VideoMME, LVBench, MLVU, LongVideoBench, EgoSchema, MVBench, TempCompass, CGBench), TVG (Charades, ActivityNet, TVGBench), VDC (VDC), and DVC (YouCook2)** benchmarks.  
- **[2025.11.21]** 🚀 Initial release of the TimeViper repository.  The paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16595).


# 📖 Introduction

We present **TimeViper**, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision-language model for efficient long video understanding. 
We introduce **TransV**, the first token-transfer module that compresses vision tokens into text tokens inside the LLM, enabling the model to process over 10,000 frames.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Hybrid MLLM Architecture**  
  Integrates native hybrid LLM for long video understanding.

- **Efficient Long Video Processing**  
  Capable of handling **over 10K frames** with significantly lower memory cost compared to standard Video-LLMs.

- **Flexible Backbones**  
  Supports MLLM construction with Transformer-based LLM backbones such as **Qwen2.5** or hybrid LLMs like **Nanov2**.

- **Advanced Techniques**  
  Includes **token dropping (TD)** and **token transfer (TransV)** for training compression.
